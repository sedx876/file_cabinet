        Winter is coming. All men must 
        die. The night is dark and full of 
        terrors. Never Resting. Winter is 
        coming. A forked purple lightning 
        bolt, on black field speckled with 
        four-pointed stars. The bear and the 
        maiden fair. What is dead may never die. 
        The tourney of Ashford Meadows. A good 
        act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad 
        act the good. Each should have its own 
        reward. Our Sun Shines Bright. As High as 
        Honor. A Lannister always pays his debts. 
        The North remembers. As High as Honor. 
        Pay the iron price. The tourney of 
        Ashford Meadows. Can a man still be brave 
        if heâ€™s afraid? That is the only time a 
        man can be brave.It is rare to meet a 
        Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for 
        dead Lannisters. I pledge my life and 
        honor to the Night's Watch, for this 
        night and all the nights to come.
